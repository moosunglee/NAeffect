Press F5 to run the codes.


ex01_main_get_fwhms_exp_gauss.m :  3D PSF Simulation
Press F5 to start the simulation, which performs NA-dependent PSF generation & FWHM calculations.

ex02_fig03bc_fitting.m :  Figure 3b & 3c fitting figures
Press F5 to start the simulation, which performs predictions of 立z/立x ratios (3b) & Laser Power (3c).

ex03_fig04.m :  3D PSF Simulation
Press F5 to start the simulation, which performs predictions of 立z, 立x (4a), scattering power (4b), and recoil heating rate (4c)
